# SQLib
A simple fabric based sql wrapper made with a focus on minecraft use cases

# Important Note:
This library is not a full fledged sql wrapper, and does not provide full access to many sql features. 
The main focus of this library is to provide an easy and simple way to store data in your mods.
If you are looking for a more advanced database I recomend taking a look at something like [Nitrite](https://github.com/nitrite/nitrite-java).

# Usage
```
test
```
